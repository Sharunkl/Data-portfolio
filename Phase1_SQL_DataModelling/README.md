## Project Overview
This project is a complete **end-to-end Data Analyst portfolio project** built using a **Books Dataset**.  
It simulates a real-world business scenario for an **Residental Library System** within an apartment community that is transitioning from manual records to a digital data-driven platform.

The project covers the full analytics lifecycle:
1) Data collection and digitization
2) Data cleaning and transformation
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4) SQL-based analytics
5) Dashboard development
6) Business insights generation
The objective is to demonstrate how data analytics can help improve reader engagement, book circulation, and library decision-making.

## Problem Statement
A community library located within an apartment complex is working on digitizing its operations to encourage more residents to read and to manage its book inventory more effectively.
Currently, most records (book issues, returns, ratings, and member activity) are either manual or unstructured, making it difficult to:
1) Track popular books and genres
2) Monitor reader engagement
3) Manage inventory efficiently
4) Understand reading trends across residents
   
This project focuses on transforming the library’s raw and manually maintained data into a structured digital dataset, followed by performing analytical processes to generate insights that add value to the apartment association.

Key goals include:
1) Digitizing and cleaning the library dataset
2) Analyzing borrowing and rating patterns
3) Identifying popular books and genres
4) Building dashboards for monitoring library activity
5) Providing data-driven recommendations to improve reading participation
